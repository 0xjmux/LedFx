***What is LedFx?***

LedFx is a network based LED effect controller with support for advanced real-time audio effects! LedFx can control multiple devices and works great with cheap ESP8266/ESP32 nodes allowing for cost effective syncronised effects across your entire house!
real-time LED strip music visualization using Python and the ESP8266 or Raspberry Pi.

What LedFx offers is the ability to  No need to spend hours on end to program a song to your LEDs, as LedFx will convert your audio to ny LedFx is a network controller that aims to enable synchronisation of multiple lights across a network. LedFx doesn‚Äôt currently support local control of LED strings, so you need a separate device (e.g., ESP8266/ESP32) to control the LEDs directly. To be able to add your LED strips to LedFx your device needs to be capable of receiving data either via the E1.31 sACN protocol or a generic (simple) UDP protocol. See below for a list of tested ESP8266 firmware that can be used with LedFx.
