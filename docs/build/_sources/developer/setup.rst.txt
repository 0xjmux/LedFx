Development Setup
================================

Building LedFx Backend
================================

In order to start developing with LedFx's core back-end you should first enabled development mode to prevent having to constantly reinstall:

.. code:: bash

    setup.py develop

This will let you run LedFx directly from your Git repository via:

.. code:: bash

    ledfx --open-ui

Building LedFx Frontend
================================

Building LedFx frontend is different from how the core backend is built. The frontend is based on React.js and thus uses NPM as the core package management. To get started, first install npm and all the requirements:

.. code:: bash

    pip install npm
    npm install

The easiest way to test and validate your changes is to run a watcher that will automatically rebuild as you save and then just leave LedFx running in a separate command window. (Note: LedFx will need to be running in development mode for everything to work). To start the watcher run:

.. code:: bash

    npm run watch

At that point any change you make to the frontend will be recompiled and after a browser refresh LedFx will pick up the new files.
