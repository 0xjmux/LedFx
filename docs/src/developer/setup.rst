Development Setup
================================

In order to start developing with LedFx's core python code you should first enabled development mode to prevent having to constantly reinstall:

.. code:: bash

    setup.py develop

This will let you run LedFx directly from your Git repository via:

.. code:: bash

    ledfx --open-ui
